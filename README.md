# Igniters Multisig UI

This repository is home to a user-friendly interface developed with Next.js for interacting with a Multi-Signature (MultiSig) smart contract within the Fuel Blockchain ecosystem. The smart contract, enables multiple parties to propose, approve, or reject transactions. These transactions are executed only when a predefined approval threshold is met. The UI is designed to offer an intuitive experience for managing owners, setting the approval threshold, and overseeing transactions, each uniquely identified. Our goal is to simplify the interaction with the MultiSig contract's complexities, making the Fuel Blockchain ecosystem more accessible and secure for DAOs and organizations.
